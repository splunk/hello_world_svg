# This is the Hello World of Choropleth SVG

This is the Hello World of Choropleth SVG. Created to show off the new Choropleth SVG Feature in the Splunk Enterprise Dashboards Beta. This is merely an example of creating a Choropleth SVG. It is intended as a jumping off point for future dashboard creation. 

## Requirements

* Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud
* Splunk Enterprise Dashboards Beta Installed

## Using this Git Repository

This is not a complete app, just an example of a dashboard, along with one single SVG needed to make the dashboard functional. So setting it up just means downloading the repository, and using the various artifacts as described below. 

1. Create a new Dashboard inside the Splunk Enterprise Dashboards Beta. 
2. Open the Source Editor. 
3. Copy and paste the information from the dashboard.json file into the Source Editor and then go back to the Graphical Editor. 
4. Click on the SVG Objects and upload the hello_world.svg file included inside of the Git Repository. 
5. Save the Dashboard.
